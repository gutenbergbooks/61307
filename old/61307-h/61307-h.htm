<h2><i>Drippings From the Fawcett</i></h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">The modern city can be likened to that grim
monster of old dreams to whom a tribute
of maidens was offered. The main difference
between them lies in the fact that his appetite
for girl-flesh had its limitations, but the
appetite of the city had none. From this vast
charnel house of hopes, beliefs and ideals files
upward a steady stream of damned souls that
once belonged to women-children, pure in
thought and deed. The crushing of one or a
thousand of these “wee modest crimson-tipped
flowers” beneath the ploughshares of city life
and temptation excites only passing remark.</p>

<p>The girl of the city has much more actual
animation than her sister of the country. This
is due to the food that is eaten and the social
conditions of excitement that surround her. The
country girl lives upon plain food and has normal
hours of rest and relaxation. She does not
encounter the sights or sounds that would tend
to divert her attention from high thoughts to
matters forbidden.</p>

<p>Such sights and sounds are never absent
from the city girl. She cannot go into the business
part of the city and walk two blocks without
being reminded of her sex. Men eye her with
glances of suggestion and invitation.</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * *</div>

<p class="dropcap">You don’t have to go to West Point for
strategy. A negro preacher in his pulpit
one Sunday said he had a few remarks
to make before the collection basket made its
peregrination.</p>

<p>“Now, brethren and sisters,” he began,
“there is just one brethren here that is untrue
to his church, untrue to his Lord—and worst
of all, untrue to his wife. Unless he puts a
five dollar bill into the contribution box I
will be compelled to call his name out.”</p>

<p>When the basket had returned and a recount
had been made, the books showed forty-two five
dollar bills and a two dollar bill with a note
pinned to it saying, “I will hand you the other
three in the morning. Please don’t give me
away.”</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * *</div>

<p class="dropcap">“Only a Mother Could Love a Prohibitionist’s
Face.” That is the inscription
which appeared on one of the banners
in the Anti-Dry parade which I had the pleasure
of witnessing in New York City while
en-route back from the big fight which ye
editor attended.</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * *</div>

<p class="dropcap">Around Robbinsdale they get up early.
Two farmers, jealous of their rising records,
became boastful and one allowed as
how he got up before three o’clock. The other
rose at two the next morning and called at his
neighbor’s house, hoping to find him in bed.
The farmer’s wife came to the door.</p>

<p>“Where is your husband?” inquired the
sleuth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why, he was around here early this morning,
but I don’t know where he is now.”</p>

<p>Gus, our hired man, insists that Deacon
Kingdon is a good shot.</p>

<p>“He is so good with his gun that he hit the
bull’s-eye the first time,” Gus exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Yes, but he had to pay for the bull.”</p>

<p>Two quarts shellac</p>

<p>One bar home-made soap</p>

<p>One pint sweet spirits of nitre.</p>

<p>Boil mixture three weeks, then strain
through an I. W. W. sock to prevent mixture
from working. Bottle and add one jackass to
each pint to give it the proper kick.</p>

<h3>This Is For Railroaders</h3>

<p>Casey, a section boss on the Great Northern
railway, in making his report to the superintendent,
used considerable profanity, so the
superintendent said: “Casey, I have lady stenographers
here and if you must use that profanity,
after this you must write your own reports.”
“A train from Duluth came lickety
skoot and passed me hand car by. Some son
of a gun left open a switch and it piled them
ten cars high.”</p>

<p class="dropcap">Georges Carpenter lost a battle
last July, but he won a greater prize
than the golden purse and the coveted
belt offered at Jersey City. The handsome
Frenchman showed America the smile of
Napoleon; the stoical smile of defeat.</p>

<p>As one of the multitude witnessing the
brief clash of France and America at Boyle’s
Thirty Acres, permit me to remark that Carpentier
<b><i>did not</i></b> live up to his reputation as
great pugilistic champion, but he more than
met his reputation as a great red-blooded gentleman.</p>

<p>The American won, but the applause usually
due the winner was lost in the outburst of surprise
of the multitude. Carpentier, instead of
hanging his head at the defeat of his hopes
and aspirations for the title, hid his sorrow
behind a great big boyish smile. He wore that
smile through the blood-stained rounds, and it
radiated as the gong clanged.</p>

<p>The soul of fighting France was behind that
smile; the same as the smile of Napoleon as
he handed over his army to Wellington at Waterloo,
and the likeness of Joffre at the first
battle of the Marne. It puzzled his primitive
opponent. Dempsey was bewildered—his face
revealed his knowledge that behind that smile
was a superior intellectual being.</p>

<h2><i>Doug’s Peacock Walk</i></h2>

</div>

<p class="by">BY RICHMOND</p>

<p class="dropcap">What are the personal peculiarities of
film people? In view of the fact that
it is our bounden duty to torment, dilate
and comment upon ye people of the screen, it
behooves us to stop now and then to observe
what they are and how they become that way,
aside from being good looking, drawing big
money and getting divorced.</p>

<p>Let’s get right down to business. Take
Allan Dwan, a well known director. Dwan
doesn’t hate himself any more than the law
provides for. In fact, there is no reason Dwan
should despise himself. He was a good electrical
engineer; became interested in pictures
and makes various flurries of coin according
to the Angels who can be dug up to back his
ventures.</p>

<p>Dwan formerly was a good athlete. He is
powerfully constructed but noticeably short.
About the studios it is well understood that
one of the few faults Dwan finds with himself
is that he isn’t just up to his own personal
idea of tallness. If he has a tender spot, it
hinges upon this item of feet up and down.
Someone conceived the idea that in order to
tab him “Napoleon.” But that line of bull<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
has been overdone and so another gag had to
be hatched up. “The Big Little Man,” that is
what those in close touch with Dwan call him
when they desire to make a favorable impression.
“The Big Little Man,” that’s a good title—better
than some of the ones that appear on
Dwan’s pictures and a lot of other pictures.</p>

<p>Thus we dispose of Mr. Dwan, a cocky,
brainy, peppy little fellow whose only regret
is that he should be a little longer. Next we
will consider Mr. Fairbanks, Mary’s present
husband, barring every state in the Union but
Nevada—and Nevada isn’t quite certain that
Mary is still married to Owen Moore. Doug
likes to tread about with his gang of retainers
at his heels. Fairbanks cottons to the custom,
styles and bequeathments of the English sporting
gentlemen who stalked abroad with a company
of idol worshippers.</p>

<p>Doug is not always the most distinguished
looking of his company. At any event, he frequently
is not the most noticeable. It was
Fairbanks that discovered the now famous
Bull Montana, who doubles for monkeys when
one is required in the cast and whose ability
to take punishment one time resulted in nine
fire hoses being turned on him at once as he
was swept down the gutter.</p>

<p>When Doug Fairbanks and Bull Montana
walk down the street together the Bull “takes
it away from him,” as they say in the pictures
when a subservient character grabs the best of
the scene from the star. Bull has a face, at
once fearsome and fascinating. He is so ugly
that crowds follow him around. It is a frequent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
spectacle in Los Angeles to see Fairbanks,
Bull Montana, Spike Robinson, Crooked
Nosed Murphy, Benny Zeidmann, the press
agent de luxe, and Mark Larkin, Fairbanks’
special representative, beating it down the
broad. Of course, Doug always struts in front,
while the others in platoon formation tread
proudly in the rear. The only place where
Doug falls down is that some of his gang look
funnier than Doug acts on the screen and the
big star stands a chance of being overlooked
in the “what the h—is coming here” attitude
that rends the atmosphere as the Fairbanks
battalion bears down upon the multitude. Yes,
Doug likes to lead his gang into the big hotel
corridors, where his cohorts then fade gracefully
into the oblivion necessary to leave Doug
alone in his solitude for the yokels to admire
and wonder at. You gotta hand it to Doug for
rushing in with his gang and then giving them
the fade away sign at the psychological moment.</p>

<p>Lottie Pickford—we have thought out loud
a time or two before in these columns about
Lottie. Unlike the demure Mary, Lottie likes
the jazz stuff, the bright lights and some good
looking young dude hanging around her. We
never saw Lottie chew tobacco, but she can
stow away a lot of the “grape.”</p>

<p>If we had our decision to make as regards
Lottie’s chief peculiarity we would say that her
idea is to be thoroughly known as Mary’s sister
by doing things that Mary doesn’t. Lottie
isn’t the first contrary girl, though, who can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
claim to be of famous family. There was Miss
Roosevelt and later Mrs. Longworth. Didn’t
the colonel himself call long and loudly for
commodious families? And did you ever read
that his daughter attained any particular fame
aside from smoking cigarettes and not rearing
children?</p>

<p>If you are a sort of a junior member of a
family and fear that you will be overshadowed
by some relative, cast for a famous mold, one
way to attract attention is to copy the other
one—backwards.</p>

<p>We come to Fatty—Roscoe Arbuckle. Roscoe’s
peculiarity just now is to have people try
and forget that his name is Fatty. Roscoe is
getting dignified. He has half a dozen cars,
just because people came to know him as “Fatty
Arbuckle” and paid a lot of dough to see
him. Just where Fatty expects to promote
himself by being Roscoe passeth understanding.
Surely he doesn’t think that he could act seriously
without being thought funny. Perhaps
Fatty is subtle. He may have tired of drawing
laughs as a result of acting natural and figures
he may get as many more by trying not
to appear natural.</p>

<p>Now we are down to Mr. Griffith. Mr.
Griffith, to our notion, is a great director.
But Mr. Griffith is more or less deftly endeavoring
to implant the idea in the public
mind that he is a poet. That is Mr. Griffith’s
peculiarity. He would not be seen much in
public; rather he seeks to attract attention by
remaining in seclusion. His well organized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
staff and his actors and actresses, who like
him much, never pass up an opportunity to
breathe it about that “Mr. Griffith is a poet.”</p>

<p>We never read any of David’s verses, but
if he is a poet, it devoutly is to be desired that
there were more poets and fewer directors
operating in pictures.</p>

<p>After all, these little peculiarities or hobbies
of the picture people are not harmful to
any one in particular. We all like to strut and
fluff and show our fine feathers. It’s human
nature.</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * *</div>

<h3>We’ll Say So!</h3>

<p>While Al. Jolson, the black-face comedian,
was touring the Pacific Coast with his latest
starring vehicle, “Sinbad,” he visited the California
insane asylum, at Napa. Passing
through one of the wards he noticed a rather
neat chap and asked the attendant the nature
of the fellow’s trouble.</p>

<p>The attendant told the comedian that it was
a new case. Had only arrived the previous
day.</p>

<p>Jolson approached the patient and inquired
“If you had only one wish in the world, and it
would be granted, what would you wish for?”</p>

<p>The patient looked at Jolson and said, “I’d
wish that Volstead was born with a thirst!”</p>

<p>With a smile Jolson replied, “You might
have been crazy when they brought you here
yesterday, brother, but you’re talking good
sense today!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<h3>Our Traffic Cop</h3>

<p>Thomas Patrick Gallagher, typical Irish
traffic copper, was stationed on Madison street
in Chicago at the point intersected by the
River.</p>

<p>One bustling Saturday afternoon, Gallagher
held up his hand to halt traffic for the draw
bridge. In front of him was a new handsome
limousine motor car.</p>

<p>While waiting for the bridge to close, a runabout
flivver crashed into the rear end of the
handsome car.</p>

<p>Gallagher was on the job promptly and
hustled over to the driver of the flivver.</p>

<p>“Phwat in hal does yez mane by smashing
into this handsome car? Haven’t you got any
eyes?” he bellowed at the meek and humble
driver, “Are you crazy? I’ve a good mind to
take you down to the headquarters, you blithering
idiot. What’s your name?” continued Gallagher,
as he extracted a pencil and notebook
from his pocket, “What is the number of your
car?”</p>

<p>The answer came back in typical Gaelic, “Me
name is Clancy.”</p>

<p>“Clancy,” replied Gallagher. “Clancy, what
part of Ireland are you from, what county?”</p>

<p>“I am from County Mayo.”</p>

<p>“County Mayo,” continued the traffic officer,
“County Mayo, say Clancy, stay here just
a minute till I go ahead to that big car and
see why in the devil he backed into you.”</p>

<h3>Ikey’s Recklessness</h3>

<p>Ikey, eleven years of age and of unmistakable
Hebrew persuasion, was taken out of
school and put to work in a nearby store, where
he was rewarded with the princely honorarium
of a dollar and a half per week. For the first
three weeks, Ikey brought home the pay envelope
on Saturday night and turned it over to
his mother. On the fourth Saturday, however,
he was five cents short.</p>

<p>“Ikey,” said his mother, “where is that other
nickel?”</p>

<p>“I need that nickel, ma,” replied Ikey.</p>

<p>For the next three weeks this dialogue was
repeated when the week’s pay was turned in.
The following Saturday Rachel had further
cause for suspicion, for there was only $1.40 in
the pay envelope.</p>

<p>“Ikey,” she said, “what have you done with
that dime?”</p>

<p>“Ma,” said Ikey, “I had to have that dime
myself.”</p>

<p>“Now, Ikey, tell your mother the truth; are
you going with a woman?”</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * *</div>

<h3>Overwhelmingly</h3>

<p>A member of Congress recently became a
parent. On announcing the news the doctor
exclaimed gleefully: “I congratulate you, sir;
you are the father of triplets.”</p>

<p>The congressman was astonished.</p>

<p>“No, no, no,” he replied, with more than parliamentary
emphasis, “there must be some mistake
in the returns. I demand a recount!”</p>

<h3>Cassidy’s Routing</h3>

<p>Employed in the Great Northern yards in
Minneapolis is a switchman whom we will call
Cassidy.</p>

<p>One day Cassidy entered the superintendent’s
office without removing his cap or pipe.</p>

<p>“I want a pass to Duluth,” he said.</p>

<p>His evident show of disrespect peeved the
superintendent. “Well, Mr. Cassidy, you
haven’t approached me in quite the proper manner,”
he answered gruffly. “Here you have
your cap on your head and your clay pipe stuck
in your mouth. Do you believe this is showing
proper respect for your superior officer? If
you desire a pass to Duluth, you must leave this
office at once, walk around for an hour or two,
and come back. As you step in my office, you
will ask for the superintendent of the Great
Northern; I will reply, ‘I am the superintendent
of the Great Northern, what can I do for
you?’”</p>

<p>Cassidy promptly departed. He had been
gone about an hour, when he came back, pipe in
his pocket and cap in his hand. He walked
briskly into the superintendent’s office and inquired
in a rather superior manner, “Are you
the superintendent of the Great Northern?”</p>

<p>“I am, what can I do for you?” was the
reply.</p>

<p>“You can go to hell, I’ve got a pass over the
Northern Pacific.”</p>

<h2><i>Naughty New York!</i></h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">It looks like a pretty dreadful affair all
the way ’round to me; here’s Mrs. Lydig
Hoyt says that skirts gotta come down because
the girls are wearing them to the ankles
in Paris; but here’s little Betty Compson, the
movie princess, says they are not to come down—not
even to the ankles.</p>

<p>“It’s the movie girls and not Parisian professional
models nor New York society women
who make the fashions for America,” says
Betty. Which, when you come to think about
it, is a terrible slam for Mrs. Hoyt—an intimation
that she is not considered a regular movie
queen, in spite of the fact that she shook the
pink teas of the Four Hundred for a part in
Norma Talmadge’s company, and is now
about to burst into the world of art with a
company of her own.</p>

<p>The truth is, New York society women have
apparently gone dippy over getting into the
movies.</p>

<p>The other day I was out at the Griffith
studio at Marmaroneck watching a starving
mob in rags crying for bread in the streets of
ancient Paris. Among the actors there was one
who stood out. She was a shriveled old woman
with thin hands and haggard eyes. Her clothes
were torn half off, showing her shrunken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
breasts and bony shoulders. When “D. W.”
gave the signal for the action to begin, she
fairly made you feel the agony of her hunger.</p>

<p>When there came, at last, an interval in
the work, she beckoned to a maid who stood
near the set. “Go out to the yacht and get me
my cigarette case,” she said.</p>

<p>It turned out that the old lady was a very
rich woman with a garage filled with imported
automobiles and a steam yacht. She just had
the “itch” to act in the movies.</p>

<p>It’s a little secret that is giggled up and
down Fifth avenue that one of the “extra
girls” in the ball room scene in “Way Down
East” was Evelyn Walsh, who is considered to
be the richest unmarried woman in the world.
Mrs. Morgan Belmont was also in the same
picture.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was the movies that did it; but
anyhow, times have changed in the old Four
Hundred in New York. It is only the Texas oil
millionairesses who continue to elevate the
haughty nose in mid-air and give you a far-away
stare.</p>

<p>Mrs. Belmont, when I saw her in a picture
studio, was sitting on the edge of a piece of
scenery, smoking a cigarette that she had borrowed
from a stage hand. She was excitedly
debating an exciting question. She was contending
that Jack Dempsey could have licked
Jack Johnson when the big dinge was at his
very best.</p>

<p>It happened that I sat in a business conference
with Anne Morgan the other day. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
was the most simple and democratic person
present. She sat still and listened until every
one else had expressed his opinion. Finally
she threw away the butt of her cigarette and
said abruptly, “Look here. We are all talking
around in circles and getting nowhere.” Then
she stated the case with the directness and
clarity of a corporation lawyer. “You know,”
she said in explanation, “My father was a
banker.” I wonder if she thought she was telling
anybody any news! J. Pierpont Morgan
was the said father.</p>

<p>Mrs. Morgan Belmont isn’t likely to squeeze
Mary Pickford out of her job. She was just
in pictures on account of her name. In the
case of Mrs. Lydig Hoyt, however, it is different.
She is really a marvelously beautiful
woman and may go far in the cinema.</p>

<p>Like most of the women in society, she is
sick of gadding around tea parties. This stuff
may be all right in F. Scott Fitzgerald flapper
novels, but gets wearisome in real life.</p>

<p>Speaking of F. Scott Fitzgerald, I understand
that Princeton University is so vexed
with this youthful prodigy that he discreetly
omits the usual dutiful visits to his alma
mater. What’s ailing Princeton is Mr. Fitzgerald’s
book, “This Side of Paradise,” in
which he told some painful truths about college
life. I couldn’t see anything so terrible about
it; but Princeton was touchy.</p>

<p>In fact, I don’t see how anybody could
“stay mad” at this child of genius. He is
really a charming boy. He looks about seventeen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
with those he-vamp blue eyes. I understand
that “This Side of Paradise” was practically
his own life, except that he really married
the young society flapper who “trun him
down” in the book. She is a very beautiful girl
and the boy genius is obviously crazy about
her.</p>

<p>Another “best seller” who is looking at the
tall buildings of New York is Harold Bell
Wright, the sales of whose books have now
amounted to something over 9,000,000 copies.</p>

<p>The first time I ever saw the illustrious
Harold was in Chicago, where he had come to
sell his first books. He was a green little
country preacher from a “riding” circuit in the
Ozark mountains in Arkansas. He was so
green that a sure-thing man would have been
ashamed to sell him gold bricks. He looked
pained when you spoke of writing for money;
he said he only wrote to give a message to
the world. I saw him again at the Waldorf
the other day. He has made a couple of million
dollars; got a divorce and a Rolls-Royce
and other modern equipment.</p>

<p>In spite of his enormous success as a best
seller, I am told that Harold has a canker eating
at his heart. He grieves because the literary
critics will not take his work seriously, but
“kid” him as a “he” Laura Jean Libbey.</p>

<p>The other day, New York was electrified by
a story that Hearst had quarreled with Marion
Davies and that that attractive young lady
was to cease to be a film star in the Hearst
studios. But if there was a row, Marion must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
have won the bout. She is not only still the
queen at the studio at One Hundred and Twenty-fifth
street, but her brother-in-law has just
been placed in supreme command. I am told
that everything is getting on with peace and
harmony—the kind of peace and harmony
where nobody dares to be the first to leave a
group and always walks out of the room sideways
with his back to the wall.</p>

<p>And now that we are speaking about Hearst—Like
all men of brilliant mind, he has his
little eccentricities. His is that he never can
find his automobile. He owns some twenty
cars, but never can find one. He brings his
car downtown; forgets it and walks away to
the nearest taxicab. The chauffeur waits
around until he knows that W. R. is lost again
and goes home. Wherefore you invariably encounter
Hearst riding around New York in sad
and disreputable looking taxicabs. Occasionally,
he asks his subordinates if “anybody
knows where I left my automobile.” Hearst,
however, is a man of penetrating intellect.
Don’t let anybody tell you the old yarn about
his success being due to his brilliant subordinates.
He has a mind that cuts like a slashing
knife.</p>

<p>To meet him personally, you would think
him the newest and meekest reporter in the
Hearst service. He comes into the offices of
his hired men with a shy bashful air and
usually says, “I hope I am not in the way.”
But just let them try to disobey his orders
and see how meek he is. Wow!</p>

<p>Our old friend, Wilbur F. Crafts, the reformer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
has spent a busy summer in New York.
He has been horrified in turn over the Dempsey-Carpentier
fight, over the frightful case of
some girls who wore one-piece bathing suits at
Atlantic City; over some good respectable families
who wanted to walk down to the beach in
their regular clothes, with their bathing suits
underneath and slip off the top layer, thus
foiling the bath house robbers. Wilbur also
had a spasm of excitement because Tex Rickard
had some children from Panama giving
some exhibitions of swimming in his big pool
in Madison Square Garden.</p>

<p>Some time ago, in a censorship hearing, I
actually heard the Rev. Wilbur admit that he
was wrong. He had presented a bill he wanted
passed, creating a national censorship. One
of his friends on the congressional committee
raised his eyes humbly to the chandeliers and
said he wanted to offer a criticism. Rev. Crafts
said he always welcomes honest criticism; he
tried to do his humble best, but if wrong, wanted
to be corrected; hence he would yield to
the congressional gentleman and accept his
amendment. The amendment was to boost the
salary of the job Rev. Crafts was after from
$4,000 to $8,000 a year. He certainly yielded
like a Christian martyr.</p>

<p>But about these girls and their one-piece
suits that shocked Atlantic City almost beyond
human endurance.</p>

<p>Near Atlantic City is a little strip of beach
called Somer’s Point. When the police chased
the Annette Kellermanns off the beach at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
Atlantic City, the mayor of Somer’s Point said
they could come to his beach, b’ gosh. And so
they went—and so the road around Somer’s
Point has been blocked all summer—and so
Mayor Robert Crissey, who is seventy-two, but
has young ideas, is famous. A discreet man
is Mayor Crissey, nevertheless.</p>

<p>After the first Sunday of the girl show, he
issued a statement in which he said he thought
one-piece suits were all right. “And,” he added
with a burst of real inspiration, “I am going
to buy my wife one just like ’em.”</p>

<p>Some one has lifted up his voice and wept
because, among the other famous New York
gin palaces to go with incoming prohibition, is
the far-famed one formerly run by Tom Sharkey,
the old sailor heavy weight fighter.</p>

<p>Tom was a funny old fellow with not much
more than a distant acquaintance with English
grammar and such.</p>

<p>When he completed his fine saloon, one of
his first visitors was his former manager, Tim
McGrath. They looked over the place together.
At length Tim said to him, “Tom, you have a
fine place, but there is one thing more you
should do to it.”</p>

<p>“And what’s that?” said Tom suspiciously.</p>

<p>“Right here above the entrance you should
have a fine big chandelier.”</p>

<p>“Yeh, I know,” replied Tom, yawning, “But
who would I get to play it?”</p>

<p>That “Garden-of-Eden” party with naked
young ladies dancing, outside of Boston, which
cost Adolph Zukor and Hi Abrams, the movie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
magnates, $100,000 to quiet, and which may cost
the Massachusetts district attorney his job,
was the second time this year the aforesaid
magnates have burst into fame.</p>

<p>They—at least one of them—is said to have
been in the big stud poker party in which a
slick gent with marked cards took in a circle
of movie men for a cool $500,000. They had
him arrested, but dropped the case because the
department of public charities of New York
set up a claim for five times the amount of the
money lost as a penalty for playing poker—which
is the New York law.</p>

<p>I can tell you a little secret about that game.
That slicker would have been trimming them
yet except for the quick wittedness of Norma
Talmadge.</p>

<p>It was at their home—of herself and her
husband, Mr. Schenk—that the game had been
taking place once a week for months. Coming
suddenly into the hall, Norma saw the slick
guest slip a pack of cards into his overcoat
pocket and take another pack. She told her
husband and the slicker was caught red-handed.</p>

<p>Even New York, the town of spenders, gave
a little gasp when the “Spanish Jade” stepped
out of Greenwich Village and went shopping
on the Avenue.</p>

<p>The lady’s real name is Elizabeth Darrow.
She was the belle of the village, when a young
naval officer named Frederick Linde Ryan blew
in with his new uniform and innocent illusions.
He was married to the “Spanish Jade” and they
began housekeeping on Riverside Drive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>The boy, struggling along on his naval pay,
tried patiently and loyally and uncomplainingly
to pay; but his debts soon amounted to
$20,000, with cigarettes at a dollar a pack and
chocolates at $5.00 a pound. The other day the
case was brought into court at the instance
of one of the boy’s friends and the court ruled
that the boy need not continue further to pay
the bills.</p>

<p>As a sort of free circus the “Village” does
well enough for a little while; but it would
seem a dubious place to find a wife.</p>

<h3>Thus It Was</h3>

<p>He was young, good looking and had plenty
of money. She was also young and good looking,
but lacked the money. Consequently she
anxiously awaited for manifestations of affection.</p>

<p>“What have you named your new island
home?” she inquired one evening, following his
description of the wonderful island he had
purchased in a neighboring lake.</p>

<p>“Isle of View,” he answered, and has since
been wondering what happened to the young
lady to make her throw herself in his arms.</p>

<p>There was a cross-eyed judge in Chicago
who had three cross-eyed prisoners brought before

severely, “I wasn’t talking to you.” The third
one said, “I didn’t say anything.”</p>

<h3>Wife—Mistress—Lady</h3>

<p class="smaller"><i>The following is translated from the German, and published
in the Gazette of the Union, February, 1856</i>:</p>

<p>Who marries from love takes a wife; who
marries for the sake of convenience takes a mistress;
who marries from consideration takes a
lady. You are loved by your wife, regarded by
your mistress, tolerated by your lady. You
have a wife for yourself, a mistress for your
house and its friends, a lady for the world.
Your wife will agree with you, your mistress
will accommodate you, your lady will manage
you. Your wife will take care of your household,
your mistress of your house, your lady of
appearances. If you are sick your wife will
nurse you, your mistress will visit you, and
your lady inquire after your health. You take
a walk with your wife, a ride with your mistress,
and join parties with your lady. Your
wife will share your grief, your mistress your
money, your lady your debt. If you are dead,
your wife will shed tears, your mistress lament,
and your lady wear mourning. A year after
death your wife marries again, in six months
your mistress, and in six weeks, or sooner, when
mourning is over, your lady.</p>

<h2><i>Whiz Bang Editorials</i></h2>

<p class="by">“<i>The Bull is Mightier Than the Bullet.</i>”</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">In the old days, to the women fell the task
of making gentlemen of the men, but not
now-a-days, according to our friend, Bob
Toole, who claims that the boys keep the girls
in line during this grand and glorious age of
jazz.</p>

<p>In dancing, conversing, playing, courting
and “spooning,” the standards of young boys
and girls were fixed in the good old colonial
days, by the girls. Their natural feminine modesty
erected sensible social barriers and the
chivalry of men made them sacred and preserved
them.</p>

<p>This order has been changed. Men now fix
the standards. Naturally, they are not as high
as they “used to be.” A man is not as particular
in things moral and esthetic as the average
girl. The modern man makes a jazz hound
of his lady. The modern girl endures a lot of
things she inherently dislikes. She puts up
with annoying behavior just to be a good fellow.
She really doesn’t like this cheek-to-cheek
and wiggly dancing; but she stands for
it, for she is too good a scout to be a kill-joy.
And just because she is such a good fellow
about it, the men—good-hearted fools!—become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
less lax in their behavior until they unconsciously
impose on good nature.</p>

<p>Fellows, we’re going back again to the standards
set by the natural modesty and sweet reserve
of the girls! And we’re going to like it,
too!</p>

<p>With wine gone, a “powerful” incentive to
excessive “good fellowship” has been removed.
With equal suffrage a fact, girls will unconsciously
resent extreme impositions on their
fine comradeship. There is certain to be a good
natured reaction on a part of the ladies. They
are going to set new standards. Not by law;
by sweet common sense. Femininity will never
revert to prudery, but girls are going to amend
sensibly that “go-as-far-as-you-like” policy of
good fellowship so that men will realize girls
are less common and more wonderful than ever
before.</p>

<p>And, we repeat, we’ll like it.</p>

<p>Go to it, girls! Make us be good!</p>

<p class="dropcap">An Ohio editor allows that a man in Columbus
got himself into a ton of trouble
by marrying two women without the formality
of divorce from the first. A Western
observer points out that a good many men in
that section had gotten that way by marrying
just one. A Southern editor has retorted by
alleging that quite a few of his friends found
trouble enough by merely promising to marry
without going any further. And an old doughboy
friend of ours collected a goodly surplussage
of grief when he was simply found in company
with another man’s wife.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<div class="starbreak">* * *</div>

<p class="dropcap">If two souls are happily mated, there is no
reason why either should live in or refer
to the past. Their Eden is in the present
and the future of what may be and not what
has been. The man or woman should be sacredly
silent about the dead past, unless there is
some person or something which sooner or
later may rise to bring darkness or death. The
Bible basis of marriage is a love which takes
for better or worse the heart which it calls its
own. People ought not to marry unless they
are so devoted to each other that any later
knowledge of what either may have been or
done would make no difference.</p>

<p>Man’s inhumanity to woman is often earthly,
selfish and devilish. Women are naturally and
generally better than men. If they err, it is
usually the man’s fault. The average young
man is fortunate to secure any girl to live with
him as his wife. Keep still and ask no questions
is the wise way. There is no double
moral standard for speech or silence for man
or woman. At the marriage altar, heaven demands
no more of the woman than of the man.
That a woman should tell the past to a man
who insists, though it is none of his business,
or that she should persist in confessing to him
when he does not care to hear it, is a piece of
folly of which some women are guilty. Where
ignorance is bliss “’tis folly to be wise.” After
marriage it will do no good to tell what you
said and did before. There are many homes
now happy, as if made under the wings of the
angels, whose members at one time left the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
paradise of innocence and wandered beneath a
roofless world.</p>

<p>Love is blind. A true and genuine lover
does not want to hear a girl’s past; and if he
did hear it from her own or another’s lips, it
would make no difference to him. If any one
is to tell let it be the man, for usually it is the
woman and not he who runs the risk of a past.
Let the man confess who places the material
above the mental and moral and thinks of a
wife as a cheap luxury, and of home as a dry-dock
of repairs. No matter how greatly discrowned,
a woman may be recrowned. With
her, heaven is in the future and not in any past,
she may serve, give, work and pray with the
love that is the crown jewel in her diadem.</p>

<p>The sweetheart who is willing to be a wife
is not man’s inferior or superior, but equal in
personal equivalent. The mere accident or
providence of sex does not entitle a man to any
special privileged of conduct before or after he
is husband. Man’s character is judged by his
estimate of women. Such a poem as Hood’s
“Bridge of Sighs” or Goldsmith’s “Folly” would
be impossible if men remembered not to act
the part of Faust to Margaret.</p>

<p>“Go in peace and sin no more,” was the command
to the fallen woman. Confess to the one you
have wronged, but don’t make a boastful show
before others. There are converted sinners in
the pulpit and prayer meeting who make a
glory of their shame, unmindful of the advice,
“See thou tell no man.” It is the unpardonable
sin of society that it would cast and keep in
deeper hell the woman with a past, though she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
be willing to purify herself in the fire of remorse
and baptize herself with tears of repentance.</p>

<p>Many a girl who once glittered in Folly’s
and Fashion’s court has later met and learned
a true love. She was silent and devoted and
today shines a holy flame in the home as wife
and mother. A woman may tell what she is
and hopes to be—not what she has been. The
man who is fool and fiend enough to insist that
the Sphinx speak is unworthy of her. Let a
man remember to forgive and forget a woman’s
past, as he hopes to have a happy home here
and hereafter.</p>

<h3>Hello! or Ohell!</h3>

<h2>Our Movie Gossip</h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">Los Angeles lawyers are laughing up
their sleeves over the story whispered in
connection with the divorce suit of Agnes
Schucker, known to the screen world as Agnes
Ayres, the Lasky leading lady, recently elevated
to stardom through the kindness of Wallie
Reid. Because of the fact that few people in
California ever knew Miss Ayers under the
name of Schucker, the divorce suit of Agnes
Schucker versus Captain Frank R. Schucker,
now with the United States Army in France,
attracted little if any attention. Thus it was,
the gossips report, when pretty Agnes Schucker
recently entered the court room of Judge Summerfield,
attired in a plain brown dress and
inconspicuous black hat, there were few in the
spectators’ gallery and none recognized the
demure plaintiff as the Lasky star.</p>

<p>Tearfully Agnes’ mother told on the witness
stand how she had to care for her daughter,
because of the alleged failure of Captain
Schucker to support Agnes. The mother’s testimony
aroused the sympathy of the court and
the spectators, and there was a mention of a
co-respondent “Lillian.”</p>

<p>Everything was going lovely for Agnes until
a cinema person from Hollywood recognized
her in the court room and unceremoniously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
tipped off her identity to the judge. Hizzoner
appeared peeved because Agnes put on a little
cinema drama all her own in his court room,
assisted by mamma’s weeps, and he threw the
case out of court.</p>

<p>Agnes’ lawyers then reopened the case on
the grounds of desertion and soon she is expecting
to be traveling in single bliss. According
to the gossips, Agnes came back into court
in the second trial her own real movie self,
and attired in a champagne colored gown
trimmed in green, and wearing a lavender hat
trimmed with ostrich plumes. Mother, so it
is reported, explained later to the judge that
she “misunderstood” the question and that she
merely meant she and Agnes lived in the same
house; not that she had to support her “victimized”
daughter.</p>

<p>Incidentally, Agnes has Wallie Reid to
thank for her rapid rise in filmdom, and Wallie,
by the way, gives so many teas and dinners
that it is said he has to have two homes
in order to accommodate all the parties, the
second one being somewhere in Laurel Canyon,
and Agnes is rated among his favorite
dinner guests.</p>

<div class="starbreak">* * *</div>

<p class="dropcap">We have heard a story concerning our
good friend Samuel Merwin, and if it
is true, we will have to give Samuel a
gold medal. Sammie is out west writing for
the movies, and recently attended an exclusive
house party at Riverside. The story goes that
on the homeward drive he was permitted to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
escort a beautiful English girl. About two
miles had been traveled, so ’tis said, when the
chauffeur reported the usual “blow-outs” and
“missings” and that Merwin and the girl had
to wait long weary hours during the “fixing”
process.</p>

<p>All of the young eligibles in California
have been trying to land the lovely English
girl, but not Merwin, according to our bevy of
Whiz Bang Bunkers, because even the most
loose-tongued gossips admit the probability
that during the two hours of waiting, Merwin
went to sleep and let the London beauty wait
alone.</p>

<p>Ah, romance, to where hath thou departed?</p>

<p class="dropcap">It wasn’t many months ago when J. Parker
Reid, the director, with his star, Louise
Glaum, and other members of the company,
took a little trip to Tia Juana and San Diego.
Of course, they went over to the Coronada
Hotel for dinner and there J. Parker Reid met
a bevy of society folk.</p>

<p>Now, you haven’t any idea how the society
folk at Coronada fuss over movie people. The
Coronada crowd are an idle set with plenty of
money, little to do and an ambition to be considered
clever. By informally hob-nobbing
with the writers and players of the movie
colony from Hollywood, they gain a new mental
punch and are able to assume some of the
glamour, always emanating from the people
who do interesting things.</p>

<p>Louise Glaum has been conscientious in her
art, you know. She is one of the really hard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
working, conscientious women of her profession,
and we’ve heard she has some dependent
relatives to support, and that she never had
much schooling, but has studied very hard by
herself, and that altogether her life hasn’t been
an easy one.</p>

<p>Louise’s pictures stopped making money a
year or two ago, then she became friendly with
J. Parker and the tide in her fortunes seemed
to change. Reid perhaps fell in love with her,
at least temporarily, and she perhaps with him,
and besides he raised capital to star her again.
The pictures were a success financially, and all
the world seemed rosy for the hard working
actress.</p>

<p>But, that trip to Coronada. J. Parker Reid,
it seems, was fussed over a wealthy Mrs. Piper.
To her, a great motion picture director maybe
was a new idol for adoration.</p>

<p>We wonder how it’s all coming out. J.
Parker Reid some weeks ago made it clear to
Louise that their affair was over. In June he
married Mrs. Piper. Life’s a funny little game
after all.</p>

<h2>Japanese Bathing Beauties</h2>

</div>

<p class="by">BY REV. GOLIGHTLY MORRILL</p>

<p class="center">Pastor People’s Church, Minneapolis, Minn.</p>

<p class="dropcap">To the religious rambler, Japan is divided
into two parts—that which is inhabited
by the Geisha girls, and that “cohabited”
by the Yoshiwara.</p>

<p>I thought more of the Geisha dancers than
the dance, and that wasn’t much. The word
“Geisha” means accomplished one, and there
are schools for their education in music and
the arts. People visit the girls more for pleasure
than for profit, and since they are one of
the institutions of Japan, I went one night to
a tea-house to see them. Making myself as
comfortable as possible on the floor, a screen
door was slipped aside, and in came a pretty
Geisha girl who touched her head to the floor
three times, sat down and looked at each one
of our party. Immediately there fluttered in
three more, and they made the room look like
an Oriental bird cage. They sang for us in a
tone that suggested an ungreased axle or a nail
drawn across a piece of glass, played on the
samisen and koto, which nothing but the genius
of a Wagner could appreciate went through a
fancy fan drill and proved themselves good entertainers,
but felt embarrassed because we
were not familiar and indecent. They acted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
serious and spoke to one another, and I asked
what was the trouble. It seems they didn’t
know what to make of us, as the average tourist
was usually boisterous, drunk and rough.</p>

<p>The Yoshiwara is the red-lantern district of
Japan. One night we formed a stag party to
visit the Tokio Yoshiwara, but we couldn’t
shake the “dears” who were as anxious to go
as we were and insisted on accompanying us.
Our rickshaws rolled through squares and
streets and miles of mud and misery, until we
came to what was in itself a “city of dreadful
night,” but all ablaze with electric lights.
Here were squares of theatre-looking buildings
in which women, dressed in bright and fancy
garb, sat by little stoves, and sullen, smiling
or smoking pipes, looked out at the spectators.
The government regulates this “social” as a
“necessary evil,” and houses, supervises and
guards the girls. In Japan it is regarded as
noble and filial for a daughter to sell herself
to support the father and family who may have
failed financially. The same thing is done in
Europe and America for wealth and social
position, but differently estimated and under
another name.</p>

<p>Here they squatted in butterfly regalia, with
silk kimona, obi, glossy black hair stuck full
of combs and gold pins, eyes painted and faces
powdered, thrumming a little guitar, squeaking
out a love-song, and making goo-goo eyes
in a way that would make one smile if he could
forget the hell-horror of the place. Some of
the inmates do not leave until death; others
return to society, which welcomes and does not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
disown; one may return to her home, loved and
respected, but with none of the fine clothes and
jewels given by her admirers during her absence.
However, the place often becomes a
matrimonial bureau, and the girl is met, courted
and selected by some Jap as his wife. In
addition to segregation, there is such a supervision
that the inmates can’t leave for even an
hour without the consent of the police.</p>

<p>Hotel life is interesting. If you are curious,
you have only to wet your thumb and thrust
it through the wall paper of your bed chamber
to get as many views as Peeping Tom had
of Lady Godiva. This hole privilege is, however,
only claimed by the traveler who has no
respect for the holy of holies at inn or temple.</p>

<p>Japan is the land of the Rising Sun—and
daughter, who with the whole family will take
their bath and leave the same water for you to
swim in unless you set your alarm clock for a
very early hour, or sit up all night to get there
first. Imagine a public bath, if you can, for
many homes have no bathroom, where the water
by 10:00 A.M. is like a roily creek after
a rain; by 3:00 P.M., yellow as the Missouri,
and by bedtime like the mud geysers of the
Yellowstone.</p>

<p>The public bath was the one thing we wanted
to see and kept asking about. Cleanliness
is next to Godliness, and after visiting 2,738
of the 3,000 temples in Kobe, I wanted to get
“next” to a public bath. At last I discovered
one and sent the guide ahead to reconnoiter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
He said, “Come.” I passed the word along and
the ladies came, but wished they hadn’t. We
entered and I became a “looker-on” at Venus in
the bath, and not one but many, who made the
painted females in the Uffizi look like chromos
or Mrs. Jarley’s wax works. They eyed us
with an indifference that made us blush and
look through our fingers for shame. With the
ease that only a model for the altogether possesses,
they posed before the mirrors, arranging
their black hair, or poised like maids of
the mist by the steam tank. Their type of
beauty is different. Jap beauty is in angles,
the American in curves. Nature made one
with a ruler, the other with a compass. As a
rule, the baths for men and women are divided
by a wooden partition at the end of which sits
the proprietor or his wife on the lookout. Formerly
there was no privacy and the fastidious
foreigners insisted that the sexes should be
separated. This was accomplished by placing
a bamboo rod between them, but even that is
discarded now in some sections. Everybody
gets into the swim, thus beautifully illustrating
the proverb, “Evil to him that evil thinks.”
O tempora! O mores!</p>

<p>One of the strongest impressions made upon
me in my journey through Japan was at Mogi,
a malodorous little fishing village, out from
Nagasaki, with so large a smell that a blind
man could easily find it by following his nose.
Coleridge, the poet, whose business it was to
rely on imagination rather than on fact, counted
sixty well-defined and several stinks at
Cologne. He would have been overpowered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
here and called for the help of a professor of
higher mathematics to enumerate the volume
and variety of odors we encountered from
Nagasaki to this town.</p>

<p>A well made road lassoes the intervening
foot-hills which are covered with cultivated
fields; the peasants were all busy, the children
were happy and more so when we threw them
peanuts instead of “pansies” for thoughts.
Men, women and oxen were carrying various
loads, but the common one was a bamboo bucket
affair balanced on both ends of a bamboo pole.
These buckets were not filled with milk, or
cheese, or vegetables, but with a substance
which they had assiduously collected in accordance
with the Scripture, “Gather up the
fragments that nothing be lost.” I can never
forget the ascent or the descent to Mogi. From
rocky road, through pretty forest, by picturesque
ravine, we reached the fishermen’s huts
with their nets by the shore and beach where
bathing mermaids can only be caught and carried
home in a camera.</p>

<h3>The Last Chortle</h3>

<p>A magician having nearly finished his act
without exciting any applause, gave his best
stunts, expecting to get a rise out of the audience,
but without result. He then advised that
he had saved his very best trick for the last
and asked all who wanted to see the devil to
raise their hands. Receiving a hearty response,
he told them to go to hell, leaving the stage

<h3>Back to Childhood Days</h3>

<p>I visited an insane hospital at Oshkosh, Wis.,
and the keeper took me through. Up on the
second floor we passed down a long hall. At the
end there was a heavily padded and ironed cell.
The keeper said to me, “The man in this cell
is the most violent and strongest man we have
here.” I looked at him. He was of Herculean
build.</p>

<p>As we turned away, there was an awful
crash and the front of the cell was thrown out
in the hall. I ran down the hall and the big
fellow right after me. I jumped out of a window
at the end of the hall and he jumped right
after me. I ran around the hospital and he
after me. The attendant stuck his head out of
a window and said to me “Why don’t you run?”
I said, “Do you think I am trying to throw this
race?”</p>

<p>I ran across a field and he was right after
me. I could hear his footsteps behind me. I
ran into a plowed field and that slowed me up.
He was gaining on me. Finally he got near to
me and he reached out and slapped me on the
back and said, “Tag, you’re it.”</p>

<h2>Musings of A Bachelor</h2>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">Between two women of equal beauty,
always pick the one who closes her eyes
when she kisses you. She’s not so likely
to think you want to marry her.</p>

<p>The proof that men do not understand
women is that they love them. The proof that
women <b><i>do</i></b> understand men is that they marry
them.</p>

<p>The first kiss is always stolen by the man.
And the last one is always begged by the
woman.</p>

<p>The length of a woman’s kiss nearly always
depends upon the breadth of her imagination.</p>

<p>To remain a woman’s ideal a man must die
a bachelor.</p>

<p>A woman’s idea of Hell—“Nobody loves me
and my clothes don’t fit.”</p>

<p>If there were only three women left in the
world, two of them would immediately convene
a court-martial to try the other one.</p>

<p>Men frequently marry to keep other men
from getting the woman they desire. They are
not always successful.</p>

<p>The final definition of love is something that
gives pain without hurting.</p>

<p>Self-respect means a comfortable sense that
you have not been found out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>When a man commits a sin, he says, “How
shall I conceal this?” When a woman commits
a sin she says, “How can I let my friends
know of this without bragging?”</p>

<p>The theory that really to know two women
one must introduce them is ridiculous. It often
results in a divorce.</p>

<p>A woman’s head is not always turned by
flattery; sometimes its peroxide.</p>

<p>When a woman starts an idle rumor, it at
once ceases to be idle.</p>

<p>One beauty of being single is that it’s a
dreadfully thrilling experience until one’s wife
finds it out.</p>

<p>It must be dreadful to meet at dinner the
man who ran away with one’s wife. It places
one under <b><i>such</i></b> an obligation!</p>

<p>If there were only one bachelor in the
world, every married woman would still think
she made a mistake when she married her husband.</p>

<p>Experience in man is something which is
brought with the tears of plain women and the
kisses of pretty ones.</p>

<p>Love without respect is an angel with but
one wing.</p>

<p>To make marriage perfect, the husband
should be deaf and the wife blind.</p>

<h3>Our Army Daze</h3>

<p>About 2:00 o’clock one morning while making

halted by a sentry on post. After giving the

surprise as he stood at port arms and said:</p>

<div class="verse">And all the water in the (hic) well,</div>

<div class="verse">In case of fire, alarm the guard.</div>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

cannot be read by your equipment.

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary

Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
